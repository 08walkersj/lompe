Notebooks to produce figures for code paper

- 01 - Cubed-sphere grid implementation - example and explanation
- 02 - Solving the 2D continuity equation using implementation of cubed-sphere grid
- 03 - SECS example - showcasing vectorized implementation of SECS equations 
- 04 - how to use the implemented conductance models for EUV and Hardy model. Example of differences in EUV conductances with different  calibrations. Also uses polplot for visulaization.
- 05 - Polplot example. How to visualize with Polarplot: coastlines, curves, grids, scatter, text, contours, and vectors on polar axes.
- 07 - Standard Lompe example with electric field as input.
- 08 - Lompe for M-I coupling (FAC as input).
