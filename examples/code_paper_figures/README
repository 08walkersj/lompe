Notebooks to produce figures for code paper


03 - SECS example.
04 - how to use the implemented conductance models for EUV and Hardy 
model. Example of differences in EUV conductances with different 
calibrations. Also uses polplot for visulaization.
05 - Polplot example. How to visualize maps, curves, grids, scatter, text, 
contours and vectors on polplot polar axis.
07 - Lompe example.
